Hi there, I am experiencing in software development for around 7 years as Senior Software Engineer. Throughout the years, I have been doing some other side-project to build the application from scratch as a full-stack engineer and be interesting in the coding challenge which I can learn and improve myself every day and brings me a chance to experience with many stacks: Java, Golang, React, Dart.

Some interesting domain I have been working with as E-commerce, Finance, Digital Banking, and Insurance and especially Blockchain recently.

Short description from mine : a highly passionate developer with a love for technology, I aspire to help people around the world by creating useful things, things that can make differences, big or small, in this digital age.
